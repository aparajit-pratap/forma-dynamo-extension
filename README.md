# Dynamo Player for Forma

This is the Dynamo Player Forma extension for connection to Dynamo. It connects to the DynamoFormaBeta package running in Dynamo Sandbox or Dynamo in Revit or Civil 3D.

It is built as a [Forma Embedded View Extension](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/forma/v1/overview/welcome-to-forma/) using the [Forma SDK](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/forma/v1/overview/welcome-to-forma/).

# Dev

For local development, install the following extension instead of creating your own: `2940afa1-5228-4144-8de6-74fa66803d86`. Saves you from having to deal with setting up an APS app and whitelisting the client_id on the DaaS side.
